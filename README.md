# News-APP
The "NewsApp" project is built using React JS and Bootstrap, leveraging the NEWS API to fetch and display news dynamically.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

# Clone the Repo.
git clone https://github.com/Suresh-Chelani/News-APP.git

# Setting Up the API Key
You need to generate your own API key from NewsAPI and put that key in the News.js component.

Steps to generate your API key:
# Visit the NewsAPI website.
# Sign up or log in to your account.
# Navigate to the "Get API Key" section and generate a new API key.
# Add the API key to your project:
# Open the News.js component file located in the src directory.
# Find the placeholder for the API key.
# Replace the placeholder with your newly generated API key.

let apiKey = "" # in this empty string you replace your API Key
